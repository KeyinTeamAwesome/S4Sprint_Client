<h1>
  Semester 4 | Final Sprint: Server + Client
</h1>

### Description

This is a reimplementation of [an earlier project](https://github.com/KeyinTeamAwesome/S3_Final-Sprint). It consists of an Express server and React client which provides a user interface to search our movie database via an API, which can be found [here](https://github.com/KeyinTeamAwesome/S4Sprint_Backend). 
## **Connecting to the Server**

1. Once in main project folder, open the terminal navigate to the client, using the command:

   ```
   cd client
   ```

2. Next, install dependencies. Enter the command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. In a separate terminal, do the same for 'server':

   ```
   cd server
   npm install
   ```
3. Next, start both apps in their respective terminals using the command:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   **NOTE**: Client runs on 3000 and server on 3500

5. To stop the server, navigate to your terminal and press `CTRL + C`.
